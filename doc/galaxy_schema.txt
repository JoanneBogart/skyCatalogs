# Proposed columns for the galaxy files

galaxy_id    Same value will be used for disk, bulge, knots belonging to
             the same galaxy
subcomponent Name of a bulge, disk or knots subtype	     
ra           Right ascension
dec          Declination
redshift     Redshift
sed_values   Array of floating point values. Precise meaning depends on model.
             Should they be float or double?
sed_path     string or array of strings; rel paths to external SEDs
gamma1       Shear parameter
gamma2       Shear parameter
kappa        Magnification parameter
spatial_pars Array of floating point values.  Precise meaning depends on model,
             which is specified in config by object type
internalAv
internalRv
galacticAv
galacticRv
            ----   and maybe also
flux_noMW_lsst_u
flux_noMW_lsst_g
flux_noMW_lsst_r
flux_noMW_lsst_i
flux_noMW_lsst_z
flux_noMW_lsst_y
(or store with-extinction values instead?  or both?)

Both "inline" and external SED will be supported.  An inline SED, if present,
will be represented by an array of floating point numbers. Their meaning
will be part of the config. An external SED will also entail some information
in the config, at a minimum a root directory for SED files. The path relative
to the root for the galaxy will be stored in the SkyCatalog. To support more
than one non-inline SED model, give each model a name and make the SkyCatalog
entry an array.
